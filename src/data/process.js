    description:
      "Removes stones and impurities from rice using weight differences",
    detailsPrimary: "4 ton/hour",
    detailsSecondary:"Armtec",
    img: Step1,
    processDetails: "Our advanced destoning machine utilizes the principle of specific gravity to separate stones and other heavy impurities from rice grains. The machine features adjustable air flow and vibrating screens to ensure maximum efficiency while minimizing grain loss. This critical first step ensures that only clean paddy proceeds to the next processing stage."

    title: "Steaming",
    description: "Hydrothermal treatment to improve rice quality",
    detailsPrimary: "16 ton/batch (1 hour)",
    detailsSecondary:"SKF Elixer",
    img: Step2,
    processDetails: "Paddy steaming involves soaking paddy in hot water followed by steam treatment. This process gelatinizes the starch, reduces the glycemic index, seals cracks in rice grains, and significantly improves milling yield. The controlled temperature and pressure ensure optimal nutrient retention while making the rice harder and more resistant to breakage."

    title: "Parboiling",
    description: "Complete soaking, steaming, and drying process",
    detailsPrimary: "Soaking: 6-8 hours, Drying: 8-9 hours",
    detailsSecondary:"SKF Elixer",
    img: Step3,
    processDetails: "Our comprehensive parboiling process includes three stages: soaking paddy in hot water (6-8 hours), steaming under controlled pressure (1 hour), and controlled drying (8-9 hours). This process forces nutrients from the bran into the grain, increases fiber content, and creates the characteristic golden color while improving nutritional value and storage life."

    title: "De-husking",
    description: "Removes husk through friction between abrasive surfaces",
    detailsPrimary: "4 ton/hour",
    detailsSecondary:"Armtec",
    img: Step4,
    processDetails: "The de-husking process removes the outer husk layer through friction between two abrasive surfaces moving at different speeds. Our machines are calibrated to minimize broken rice while ensuring complete husk removal. The separated husk is collected via suction system for further use as biomass fuel."

    title: "Polishing & Silky Finish",
    description: "Whitens and polishes rice for premium finish",
    detailsPrimary: "4 ton/hour each",
    detailsSecondary:"Armtec",
    img: Step5,
    processDetails: "Our two-stage polishing process first removes the bran layer to whiten the rice, followed by silky polishing using water and air spray. This creates the characteristic shine and smooth texture that consumers expect from premium rice while maintaining the grain integrity."

    title: "Color Sortex",
    description: "Optical sorting removes discolored and foreign particles",
    detailsPrimary: "4 ton/hour",
    detailsSecondary:"Armtec",
    img: Step6,
    processDetails: "Advanced optical sorting technology uses high-resolution cameras and intelligent software to detect and remove discolored grains, stones, glass, and other foreign materials. The machine can sort based on color variations as subtle as different shades of white, ensuring only premium quality rice reaches the final packaging."

    title: "Length Grading",
    description: "Separates rice by grain length for uniform quality",
    detailsPrimary: "4 ton/hour",
    detailsSecondary:"Armtec",
    img: Step7,
    processDetails: "Length grading ensures uniform rice quality by separating grains based on their length. The machine uses precisely calibrated compartments on an inclined conveyor system. This process is crucial for basmati rice where grain length is a key quality parameter for premium pricing."

    id: 8,
    title: "Packaging",
    description: "Automated packaging in 25kg, 30kg, and 50kg bags",
    detailsPrimary: "35-ton silo capacity",
    detailsSecondary:"",
    img: Step8,
    processDetails: "Our automated packaging system ensures consistent weight and proper sealing for all package sizes. The system includes weighing, filling, and sealing stations with quality control checkpoints. Rice is stored in climate-controlled silos before packaging to maintain optimal moisture content."
