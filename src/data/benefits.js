    title: "Higher in Vitamins & Minerals",
    description: "Enriched with thiamine, niacin and magnesium",
    info: "The parboiling process forces nutrients from the bran into the starchy endosperm, making parboiled rice richer in vitamins (like thiamine and niacin) and minerals (such as magnesium) than regular white rice. This process can increase the vitamin content by up to 80%."

    title: "Lower Glycemic Index (GI)",
    description: "Better blood sugar control",
    info: "The parboiling process changes the rice's carbohydrate structure, resulting in a lower GI (54-68) compared to white rice (70-80). This means it causes a slower, more gradual rise in blood sugar levels, which is particularly helpful for individuals managing diabetes."

    tag: "Quality",
    title: "Longer Shelf Life",
    description: "Reduced spoilage risk",
    info: "The parboiling and drying process reduces the moisture content and creates a protective barrier around the grain, increasing its storage stability and preventing it from spoiling easily. This makes it ideal for long-term storage and export."

    tag: "Quality",
    title: "Non-Sticky Texture",
    description: "Firmer, separate grains",
    info: "Parboiled rice grains are less sticky and more separate when cooked, offering a firmer texture than regular white rice. This makes it perfect for dishes where distinct, separate grains are desired, and it holds its shape well in various cooking methods."
